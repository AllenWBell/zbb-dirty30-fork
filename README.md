### What is this repository?

This repository, "zbb-dirty30-fork", is for tracking updates necessary for the `dirty30.inc` file of ZB Block prior its next eventual mainlined release. I created this to expedite distribution of updates for until this next mainlined release occurs. I'll probably delete this repository afterwards, because it'll no longer serve a purpose after that time.

There's also another repository, "[zbb-badip-fork](https://github.com/Maikuolan/zbb-badip-fork)", for tracking updates necessary for the `dirty30.inc` file of ZB Block prior its next eventual mainlined release.

ZB Block (and therefore this repository) is licensed under GNU/GPL v2 and can be obtained free of charge from **[http://www.spambotsecurity.com/zbblock_download.php](http://www.spambotsecurity.com/zbblock_download.php)**.

This repository is intended for those users of ZB Block that make use of the **beta signatures 77g** signatures set. If you're not already keeping up-to-date with the latest beta signatures, or if you're using the **unblocked signatures**, then, this repository **WON'T** be of any value to you (and potentially won't work as intended, anyhow, due to some small required changes brought about as of a recently mainlined beta signatures update).

This fork is based upon the **D30-2014-11a** iteration of `dirty30.inc` as contained within the **beta signatures 77g** signatures set, **[originally released February 24th, 2015](http://www.spambotsecurity.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=2992)**.

**Directories:** 77g contains the original, verbatim, 77g beta signatures `dirty30.inc` file, whereas 77g+U contains my fork. You could diff the two files for comparison if you wanted to. The "+U" is to signify that it's an unofficial fork (official releases don't contain that marker).
